Executive Summary:

Sometimes people take education for granted, overlooking that not everyone has the privilege to experience it. 
Many students face financial struggles, which can pose challenges when accessing university education, particularly if they lack the means for a personal vehicle or if they live so far,
public transportation is not an option. However, these circumstances should not impede their ability to pursue higher education and better themselves.
