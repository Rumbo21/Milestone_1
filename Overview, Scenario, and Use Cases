Overview, Scenario, and Use Cases:

RideMate is a rideshare application that has been developed by a group of college
students. The goal of the appliance is to provide transportation services for college
students so they can travel all over campus. Also, our goal is to ensure that we have fair
and reasonable pricing for the rideshares. We can offer competitive pricing options,
including student discounts or discounted rates for frequent users. This can make the app
more appealing to cost-conscious college students who are looking for affordable
transportation options within their limited budgets. Ridemate will include enhanced
safety measures because we do emphasize our commitment to ensuring a safe and secure
transportation system/experience for college students. Also, we can do a seamless
integration with Campus Life. Our application could establish partnerships/integrations
with the college administration or student services. We could also collaborate with
campus security for enhanced safety measures, integrating with the college’s official app
for seamless navigation and scheduling, etc.
Scenarios
● Morning Commute: Sarah, a college student, uses a ride-sharing app to request a
ride from her off-campus apartment to the university every morning. The app
matches her with a nearby driver who drops her off at the main entrance of the
campus, saving her time and hassle.
● Late-Night Study Session: John is studying late at the library on campus and
realizes it's past midnight. Feeling unsafe walking alone at this hour, he opens the
ride-sharing app to request a ride back to his dormitory. The app promptly assigns
a driver who picks him up and safely drops him off at his dormitory entrance.
● Group Outing: A group of friends wants to go to a concert happening downtown.
Instead of relying on public transportation, they use a ride-sharing app to request a
ride together. They select a meeting point on campus, and the app matches them
with a driver who can accommodate their group size. The driver takes them
directly to the concert venue and later returns to pick them up for a hassle-free ride
back to campus.
● Off-Campus Errands: Lisa needs to run errands outside of the campus area. She
uses the ride-sharing app to request a ride to the grocery store, bank, and
pharmacy. The driver waits for her during each stop and then takes her back to
campus. This saves her time and eliminates the need for multiple transportation
arrangements.
