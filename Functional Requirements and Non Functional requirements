High-level Functional Requirements:

Non-Functional Requirements:
The Non functional requirements are those that determine the  systems operating parameters. These parameters govern how the doftware will behave in different instances
and will form a base for its efficient and uneffciient operation.
1.Performance 
The performance requirements of the webpage willcount on a number of varying parameters.
1.1Responsiveness- This is the ability of the website to load on a variety of screen sizes and resolutions as well. The typical screen sizes that should be catered for
is the typical 11.6 to 17 inch latop screens and also cateres for 19 to 30 inch desktop monitor screens as well . The resolution should be capable of handling from the lowest
1280 x 1024 to the higest range of 1920 x1200.
1.2. User Concurrency-The system should be efficient to handle multiple users at a time. For this project we will avaerage 10 people acessing the webpage at a time with the system
not slowing down. Any increase in users at a single instance will result in slowing down or lagging of the user interface. We will strive to have a load time under
2 seconds which is an acceptable industry standard.
1.3. Transaction speed per request- The transaction speed should be under five seconds to avoid users from getting impatient which may lead them to leave the webpage 
ideally we will be aiming for a time of about 3 seconds.
