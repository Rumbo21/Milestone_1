High-level system architecture:

1. Programming Languages: Javascript, HTML, CSS - These languages will be
used in the development of the website's web page and front end to serve as an
interface for the use.
2. Frameworks: React, Node - Javascript frameworks that will be used for allowing
interactions between the website and its users. React will make the basis of the
front-end interaction like user login and registration. Whilst node will be the
framework that will allow for management of the backend.
a. Google Login: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-google-login -
Used to communicate Google login data between both front and backends.
b. Additional Library: https://chakra-ui.com/ - libraries to aid in the
development and management of primarily front-end javascript
frameworks.
3. Development Tools: Visual Studio, GitHub - Tools used to allow for a steady
development flow as GitHub will host the project and allow for project members
to work on their portions individually, and visual studio as a code editor for html,
javascript, and CSS.
4. Core APIs: Uber API - The Uber API will be used to allow for the tracking,
managing, and scheduling of rides at designated or user-specified locations.
5. Supported Browser: Chromium browsers - As the front end of our service is a
web page, the website will be developed to support modern browsers and
especially browsers based on Chromium such as google chrome, opera, and
Microsoft Edge.
6. Bootstrap Templates: https://getbootstrap.com/ - A bootstrap template will help
to bring a friendly, interactive, and intuitive design to our site
